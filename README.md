# Incomplete Buggy Web-server

The server itself is incomplete, nor is it standard-complying. Don't use it. It contains bugs and many inefficiency because it was written two years ago when I was reading CS:APP. I planned to fix those bugs and rewrite it together with a network programming lib but never have time to do so. I put it up here so I can delete it from local.

The most valuable file is probably `ipv4_addr.h`, which describes a ipv4 address. I wrote this recently. Remember to remove the `inline` specifier if you want to use it.
